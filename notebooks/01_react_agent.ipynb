    "# building a ReAct agent\n",
    "\n",
    "in our last notebook (`00_llm_call.ipynb`), we learned how to make basic LLM calls with function calling. Now we'll implement the **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern** - a fundamental building block for AI agents also known as llm in feedback loop. to build really good agentic system you need figure how to manage context without that the agent's performance will degrade for long horizon tasks way before reaching the max context lenght.(even for model with 1M context length). \n",
    "\n",
    "- in our agent hakken we have use the peristent todo list for managing the context for long coding tasks.\n",
    "- and also we have long-term memory feature which save memory across session do it does not need to start fresh\n",

    "### what is [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629)?\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct stands for **Reasoning** and **Acting**. It's a pattern where the agent:\n",
    "1. **Reasons** about what it needs to do\n",
    "2. **Acts** by calling tools/functions  \n",
    "3. **Observes** the results\n",
    "4. **Repeats** until the task is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "this creates a cycle: Think → Act → Observe → Think → Act → Observe...\n",
    "\n",

    "- how to implement a ReAct loop\n",
